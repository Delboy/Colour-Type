# Colour Type
Here is a link to the live project. (https://delboy.github.io/Colour-Type/)

I decided to make a game that was inspired by a neuropsychological test that I discovered a few years back. The test shows you a series of words that spell one colour but are coloured in another and asks you to speak out the colour of the word and not the word itself. I thought I could make this into a game where not only the word and colour changes but the question of whether to spell out either the word or the colour also changes. 

## Design
- __Colour Scheme__
    - I wanted to keep the colour scheme plain and simple as to not distract the user from the colouring of the question word.
- __Typography__
    - The game only uses the font 'indie flower' as it has a chalkboard like handwritting quality which gives the page a game like feel. Sans sarif was used as a fall back font incase of any problems loading the page.
- __Wireframes__

## Features
- __Title__
- This areas simply displays the name of the game.
- __Rule Area__
- The rule area explains the rules of the game, giving two examples to aid the user.
- __Options Area__
- Here the user can change the difficulty of the game and also choose wether to mute the sound or not. The difficulty settings disappear when the game starts and reappear when the game ends. This is to stop the user from changing difficulty halfway through a round. 
- __Game Area__
- The game area consists of 
     - A 'start game btn' which runs the game. This button disappears once the game is running and reappears when the game ends.
     - A question area where the current question will be displayed and a text box with submit button fo the user to enter his answer.
     - A Timer showing how many seconds left till the game ends. 
- __Score Area__
- The score area which displays the users current score and his high score. 
- __Feedback Area__
- This section is hidden until the round finishes on which it will display a message to the user noting him of his score and possible new high score.
