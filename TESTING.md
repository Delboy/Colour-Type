## User stories Testing

*As a user I want to be able to understand the rules of the game.*
- If on desktop the user can see the rules of the game as soon as they land on the page.
- If on smaller devices the rules are easily accessible from a dropdown menu.
- Inside the rules two examples are given to help aid the user understand the game.
- If the user scores 0 the feedback box at the end of the round will encourage the user to read the rules. 

![rules](assets/readme-assets/images/rules.png)

*As a user I want playing the game to be intuitive.*
- The amount of controls needed for the game were kept minimal.
- There is only one button on the entire site that the user needs which is the start button.
- Starting the game automatically focuses the answer box meaning the user can begin punching in answers straight away withouting having to manually click it.
- There is also a visual cue letting the user know that they can hit the enter key instead to start the game.

![game area](assets/readme-assets/images/game.png)

*As a user I want feedback on how I'm scoring.*
- Inside the game area there is a scoreboard that updates in real time.
- Inside the game area there is a scoreboard for your highscore that updates at the end of each round.
- Audio cues let the user know if they are answering correctly or not.
- Visual cues such as the answer box flashing red for incorrect answers also help aid the user to how well theyâ€™re doing.
- The feedback box at the end of the round will display your score and your highscore.
- If the user beats their high score then the page will play a fanfare sound effect and flash the screen through multiple colours for a few seconds.

![score](assets/readme-assets/images/scores.png)

*As a user I want the game to be enjoyable regardless of my skill.*
- The user can change the difficulty in the game by reducing the amount of time they have to answer each question correctly.
- More points are awarded for higher difficulties which encourages the user to keep playing so that they can increase their skill and eventually score higher. 

![options](assets/readme-assets/images/options.png)

*As a user I want the game to be aesthetically pleasing.* 
- The imagery chosen was to make the site look fun and unthreatening. 
- The theme was a school game that had been scribbled onto a whiteboard. 
- The rules were made to look like they had been jotted down onto some scrap paper on a clipboard.
- The font and boxes were made to look like they had been written with a whiteboard marker.
- The game was kept very minimalistic and colours kept to a minimum for two reasons:
1. To keep the game clear and concise with nothing to distract the user.
2. So the colour of the word in the question would not clash with anything in its surroundings.

## Further Testing

- Testing was done throughout development using a combination of Chrome Developer tools and console logs. Each Time a new function was created a console log was used before the relevant code was implemented to ensure that the function was wired up correctly.
- The site was tested on google chrome, edge, firefox and safari browsers.
- The site was viewed on multiple devices such as desktop (including an ultra wide monitor), iphone, ipad, ipad mini, and laptop.
- Responsiveness was tested using google chrome dev tools to check multiple device sizes.

### Bugs

 - The sound effects do not sync up with the game correctly when played on a phone or tablet.
 - The background animation that triggers when you beat your high score causes distortion on some elements when viewed on a phone or tablet.
 - *When using chrome dev tools if you resize the page to under 700px then you have to refresh the page for the rule section to close when clicked/touched.
